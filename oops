ABSTRACTION
      Abstraction in object-oriented programming is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details while only showing the essential features of an object.
      It is used to manage complexity and allow the creation of a model that represents an application component
ENCAPSULATION
       Encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that involves bundling data and methods into a single unit, known as a class.
       It creates a protective barrier by wrapping the data and methods within a class, and it is often implemented using access specifiers such as private, public, and protected.
INHERITANCE
       Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class
       It promotes code reuse by enabling a new clasS to take on the attributes and methods of an existing class
TYPES OF INHERITANCE
        Single Inheritance
        Multiple Inheritance
        Multilevel Inheritance
        Hierarchical Inheritance
        Hybrid Inheritance
POLYMORPHISM
        Polymorphism is achieved through the use of inheritance, interfaces, and method overriding
        Polymorphism in OOPs refers to the ability of objects to take on different forms or behave in different ways depending on the context in which they are used.
DATA HIDING
         It is a technique that protects the data within a class from unwanted access and prevents unneeded intrusion
         By making data members private, they can only be accessed within the same class, providing a level of security and preventing unauthorized access or modification.
